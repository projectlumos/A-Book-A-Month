# A Book A Month
Adding perspective and getting into that reading habit. One book at a time.

Book pool will hold all the books we have heard about and want to read/recommend. Either pick a book from the books pool and add it under your name for that month or just select an existing one. 

If you hear about a good book, add it to the book pool with a short summary.

# Book Pool
Format [Name-Author: Short description]
- **Animal Farm - George Orwell**: A nice satirical account of modern politics explained through simple animals at an animal farm.
- **Predictably Irrational - Dan Ariely**: We make a lot of irrational mistakes and corporations take advantage of our predictability. Knowing them can make us slightly resistant to such vulnerabilities present in ourselves.
- **Zero to One - Peter Thiel**: Good startup wisdom, insights from someone who's been there, done that.

# A Book A Month
Adding perspective and getting into that reading habit. One book at a time.

Book pool will hold all the books we have heard about and want to read/recommend. Either pick a book from the books pool and add it under your name for that month or just add a new one to the books pool and select that.

If you hear about a good book, add it to the book pool with a short summary.
